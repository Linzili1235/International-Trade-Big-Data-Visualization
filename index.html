<h1>How is the US involved in international trade before and after the COVID-19 outbreak?</h1>
<p>
    World trade can be affected by productivity, supply and demand, diplomatic relations, as well as international events like COVID-19 outbreak. 
    We are intrigued by the international trade datasets from UN Comtrade because we would like to investigate how the US was involved in international trade 
    during the pre-COVID-19 period, and how that changed when the pandemic began to impact the economy. 
    The change could be in the share of imports and exports, could be in the countries that it cooperates with, and could be in the commodity types. 
    To address these problems, we are going to build different types of data visualizations to vividly describe and figure out the relationships 
    among different attributes.
